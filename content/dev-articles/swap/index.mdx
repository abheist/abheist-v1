Here is the way:

```javascript
let [a, b, c] = [10, 20, 30]

;[a, b, c] = [b, c, a]

// swapped: a = 20, b = 30, c = 10

let [d, e] = [40, 50]

;[d, e] = [e, d]

// swapped: d = 50, e = 40
```

Now lets jump into details. For swapping, traditionally I used to do with temporary variable, like:

```javascript
let a = 10,
  b = 20

let temp = a
a = b
b = temp

// a = 20, b = 10
```

But there was a better way to same in python:

```python

a = 10
b = 20

a, b = b, a

# a = 20, b = 10

```

and then come the es6 with the array destructuring, like:

```javascript
let [a, b] = [10, 20]
let [c, d, e, ...rest] = [30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]

// a = 10, b = 20, c = 30, d = 40, e = 50, rest = [60, 70, 80]
```

so, we can use the array destructuring to swap the value.
