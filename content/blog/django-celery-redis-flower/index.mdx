Here I‚Äôm assuming you already have your basic [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project setup. And, already know what [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html) is? if not, I‚Äôll suggest getting a basic understanding of it [here](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html). So let‚Äôs just directly jump into the steps.

_**Please follow the comments to get a basic understanding of the code. And in code `meupBackend` is a project name. Please replace that with your project name. ü§ò**_

Install celery into your project. As celery also need a default broker (a solution to send and receive messages, and this comes in the form of separate service called a message broker). Check the list of available brokers: [BROKERS](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/brokers/index.html#broker-overview). So you can directly install the celery bundle with the broker. [Bundles available](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html#bundles).

2. list of

```shell
(env)$ pip install "celery[redis]"
```

Once installed. Head to the project folder which contains `settings.py` and create a new file called `celery.py` and put the following code into it.

```python {3-4}
### celery.py

import os
from celery import Celery

# set the default Django settings module for the 'celery' program.
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'meupBackend.settings')

app = Celery('meupBackend', backend='redis', broker='redis://localhost:6379')

# Using a string here means the worker doesn't have to serialize
# the configuration object to child processes.
# - namespace='CELERY' means all celery-related configuration keys
#   should have a `CELERY_` prefix.
app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')

# Load task modules from all registered Django app configs.
app.autodiscover_tasks()

@app.task(bind=True)
def debug_task(self):
    print('Request: {0!r}'.format(self.request))

```

and now head over to `__init.py__` of the same folder and put the following code.

```python

### __init__.py

from __future__ import absolute_import, unicode_literals

# This will make sure the app is always imported when
# Django starts so that shared_task will use this app.
from .celery import app as celery_app

__all__ = ('celery_app',)

```

and now head over to `settings.py` and insert the following code into respective places.

```python

### settings.py

BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379'
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379'
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['application/json']
CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # others app
    'celery',
    'django_celery_results',
    'django_celery_beat',
]

"""
django_celery_results:
This extension enables you to store Celery task results using the Django ORM.
"""

"""
django_celery_beat:
This extension enables you to store the periodic task schedule in the database.
The periodic tasks can be managed from the Django Admin interface, where you can create, edit and delete periodic tasks and how often they should run.
"""

```

and now, add a basic task somewhere in your app.

```python

### tasks.py (in any of your app)

from __future__ import absolute_import
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def test(param):
    return 'The test task executed with argument "%s" ' % param

```

So, up until now. We‚Äôve done the celery integration with Django. Now, go to your terminal and install `redis` server. This is mainly the broker server, what we installed with celery before was a python package which helps us to talk üòÖ to this server.

```shell
### Terminal

(env)$ brew install redis

# once installed, run:
(env)$ redis-server

# Terminal 2, open another terminal or tab
(env)$ redis-cli ping
pong

```

If you get the `pong` response, then you‚Äôre fine to move forward, can quit the server and close the terminals.

If you‚Äôre on Windows and Linux, please check out how you can install the Redis here: https://redis.io/download. Now‚Ä¶ run:

```shell
(env)$ python manage.py migrate
```

This will reflect the migrations of `django_celery_result` and `django_celery_beat` . Now install the `flower` with the following command.

```shell
(env)$ pip install flower
```

Once installed. Open 3 terminals and run:

```shell

### Terminal 1

(env)$ redis-server
```

Terminal 2:

```shell

### Terminal 2

$ python manage.py runserver
```

Terminal 3:

```shell

### Terminal 3

(env)$ flower -A meup ## here `meup` is a project name
```

Now your project will be running on `localhost:8000` , Redis will be running on port `6379` , and flower will be running on `localhost:5000`.

Please make sure your Redis server is running on a port `6379` or it‚Äôll be showing the port number in the command line when it got started. So put that port number into you Redis server config into celery configurations file.
