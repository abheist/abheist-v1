![Heart of the one](./heart-of-the-one.jpeg)

An angel for some,<br />
a demon for some,<br />
for me, it’s the heart of the one.

Never want to hurt,<br />
keep many secrets beneath the blood.<br />
sob in the dark,<br />
but, people think, it’s beat of the heart.

No one thought, no one observes,<br />
but, it supplies tears as blood.

One day someone came,<br />
took it out from the dark,<br />
she kissed it,<br />
loved it,<br />
played with it,<br />
put it with her heart,<br />
and makes it her life part.

Daily she played,<br />
daily she fought,<br />
But, never she threw it out.

one day, an unknown came,<br />
who kissed her,<br />
loved her,<br />
and used to play with her.

He took out my heart from her,<br />
and threw it on the street,<br />
then there is nothing more than weep.

An angel for some,<br />
a demon for some,<br />
for me, it’s the heart of the one.

Never want to hurt,<br />
keep many secrets beneath the blood.<br />
Sob in the dark,<br />
but, people think, it’s beat of the heart.

No one thought, no one observes,<br />
but, it supplies tears as blood.<br />

🙏
