Whenever this question arises, “What I’m good at ?”. It’s never comes alone, there are so many supportive questions which come along with it. It’s an universal dream to pursue what we’re passionate about. Sometimes, problem comes that the things we care about are the things which we do best. No problem..

There are some question which help you which field/career suited me best.

- **What makes you feel strong?**
- **What makes you stand since you childhood?**

As a child we do what we love to do, even it makes us odd. But if you look back to your childhood, there’s an immense talent. Each and everything you do in your childhood, somewhere that makes you different from other. Find that something, what makes you different and what makes you feel good and where you want to pursue you career.

> You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. — Steve Jobs.
