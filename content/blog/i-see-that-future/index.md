![I see that future](./i-see-that-future.jpeg)

Here there somewhere,<br>
I see that future.<br>
Flying below those flyovers,<br>
hovering over those high buildings,<br>
inside that car,<br>
out of that cubicle,<br>
I see that future.<br>

Here there somewhere, <br>
I see that future.

Helping those who are in need, <br>
No child roaming asking for money, <br>
Sitting beside the road, <br>
just crying with a baby, <br>
That lady, why see‚Äôs not working, <br>
I see that future without poverty, <br>
Where everyone is literate, <br>
Everyone is contributing to a better world, <br>
Here there somewhere, <br>
I see that future.

I see something in you, <br>
I see something in me, <br>
I don‚Äôt know what it is, <br>
But I see that in you, me and in all of us, <br>
That we can do it.

Here there somewhere, <br>
I see that future, <br>
Where life is good, <br>
Where people are happy, <br>
Where there is no pollution, <br>
Where there are greenery and no traffic, <br>
Where we know our neighbours, <br>
Where we encourage our colleagues, <br>
Where there is no back-bitching, <br>
Where there are lies, but for good, <br>
Where there is anger, but of love, <br>
Here there everywhere I see that future.

I see that future, where there are dreams, <br>
which are meant to be fulfilled, <br>
Where there are obstacles but with determination to overcome it, <br>
I see that future, where the nation is just one, <br>
Where there is no fight over land, <br>
Where there is no fight for power.

I see that future which is full of love and care, <br>
I see that future where the earth is green, <br>
Where we are growing more trees, <br>
Where there are more forests, <br>
Where there is a place for all beings, <br>
Where we care about all.

I see that future, <br>
I see my future.

This is what my dream is, <br>
which pushes me hard, <br>
Which sometimes, makes me wonder, <br>
which sometimes make me think, <br>
Which sometimes jiggles me, <br>
Which sometimes motivate me, <br>
How it will going to happen, <br>
How it will going to come true, <br>
I see that future, in my dreams, <br>
Those dreams which are not dreamed at night, <br>
Those dreams which are always in front of my eyes, <br>
Those dreams, which my eyes want in reality, <br>
Those dreams, dreams which are going to fulfil, <br>
I see that future. Where family live together, <br>
Where friends are true friends, <br>
where a person is a person, <br>
Where love is love, <br>
I see that future.

Yes, I see that future, which was our past, <br>
Yes, I see that what we had, had gone. <br>
And, I see that future, where we are going. <br>
I see that future.
