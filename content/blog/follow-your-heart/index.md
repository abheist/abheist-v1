We all live a very different life, dreams are many, time is less. Some people hesitate to follow, some don’t want to take the risk and some are those who always compare themselves to others.

> You, you are the only one who has to move forward and take a step and make it a stepping stone.

People around you always make you feel like getting a “JOB” is the ultimate aim of life. The job isn’t everybody’s priority in life. Some want to work in Google, Microsoft, Facebook or an Apple. Some want to change the world and develop something that can help millions of people all around the world. And, some just want to earn enough to live a comfortable life. And there are some legends who want to focus on their skills, relationship and wants to live happily ever after with their true love. Whatever you want to do, do it, do not hesitate.

Find what moves you, excites you, that gives you goosebumps — it doesn’t need to be a high earning job.

> It’s better to be a pirate than to join the Navy. — Steve Jobs

You might take some time to realize what moves you. You may need months, years, or a half-life. But the search is always worth it. In the end, your life is your own story, different from every other story in the Universe. So, keep looking and believe that life is leading you where your heart belongs.

> Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. — Steve Jobs

Don’t think too much about the future. Plans never work. Just do what you want to do right now and you’ll be good. Every road will lead you where you want to go, one road might be long or others might be sort. But, in the end, you’ll definitely reach your destination. Sometimes, you feel like you don’t know what you are doing, where you are heading, or even you’re on the right track?. This is how it supposed to be. This is how life is. It’ll never let you feel ease.

Never follow road what others follow. Think, calculate and follow your heart.

> Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

🙏
