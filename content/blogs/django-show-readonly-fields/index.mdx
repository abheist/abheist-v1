As seen in (Add created_at and updated_at in base class)[./django-automatic-date-time-fields], we can add automatic date and time fields in Django models. But, Django does not show these fields in admin by default. We need to add them manually.

## Add readonly field in Django admin

```python
class BaseAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    readonly_fields = ('created_at', 'updated_at')

		class Meta:
		    abstract = True
```

and then add this class in admin.py

```python
clss MyModelAdmin(BaseAdmin):
    pass
```

register the model with this admin class.

```python
admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)
```
