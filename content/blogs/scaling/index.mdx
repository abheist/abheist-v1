# Scaling

Scaling is of two types:

- Vertical Scaling
- Horizontal Scaling

**Vertical Scaling** refers to **scale-up**, which means adding more power to your server (CPU, RAM, etc.).

**Horizontal Scaling** refers to **scale-out**, which allows you to scale by adding more servers to your pool of
resources.

### Vertical Scaling

- When traffic is low, it‚Äôs a great option
- Simplicity is its great advantage

Though vertical scaling has some hard limits

- It‚Äôs impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a single server
- Vertical scaling does not have failover and redundancy. If a server goes down, your product goes down with it
  completely.

### Horizontal Scaling

It is more desirable for large-scale applications due to the limitation of vertical scaling.
