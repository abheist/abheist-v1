As I believe in failing fast when building anything (mostly while developing). It's always a better idea to start with already existing building blocks. Following are some component liraries which I rely on when starting with anything, mostly for react. For anything Angular, I prefer Angular Material.

- [Fluent UI Web Components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fluent-ui/web-components/)
- [MUI: The React component library](https://mui.com/)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [Material Design](https://material.io/develop)
- [Chakra UI - A simple, modular and accessible component library](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Reakit - Toolkit for building accessible UIs](https://reakit.io/)
