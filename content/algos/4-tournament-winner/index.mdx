**For those times when you need to use `background-image` instead of using `img` tag because of some design related constraints.**

With background image, there is no attribute for alternate text `alt`. But there is a way to do it.

```jsx
<div
  role="img"
  aria-label={article.img.title}
  style={{
    background: `url(${article.img.src})`,
    backgroundPosition: 'center',
    backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat',
    backgroundSize: 'cover',
  }}
>
  <p className="hidden">{data.frontmatter.title} image</p>
</div>
```

Here, the trick is using `role` and `aria-label`, that is it. We're setting the role of the div to img. And providing the alternate text with the help of aria-label.
