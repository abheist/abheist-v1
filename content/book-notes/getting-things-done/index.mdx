It’s not what we have in our life, but who we have in our life, that counts. —J. M. Laurence

The methods I present here are all based on three key objectives: 
1. Capturing all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you—now, later, someday, big, little, or in between—in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind;
2. Directing yourself to make front-end decisions about all the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate at the moment; and
3. Curating and coordinating all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play, at any point in time.

A paradox has emerged in this new millennium: people have enhanced quality of life, but at the same time they are adding to their stress levels by taking on more than they have resources to handle.

Chaos isn’t the problem; how long it takes to find coherence is the real game. — Doc Childre and Bruce Cryer
